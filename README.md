# Analysis-of-ECG-Signals-Using-Hybrid-Lossless-Compression-Techniques-for-Enhanced-Data-Management
This project presents a VLSI-based hybrid lossless ECG compression scheme that combines Run-Length Encoding (RLE) and Golomb–Rice Coding (GRC) to improve compression efficiency while preserving signal integrity.
